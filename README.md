<h2> Hey! I'm Mohit Gore.</h2>

<h3> About Me </h3>
<p>An overly ambitious 17-year-old lover of words, film, logic, poetry, and prose.</p>

<h3> What I've Been Doing Lately </h3>

- 💾 &nbsp; (Slowly) getting back into coding. I recently updated my website and I think it's pretty neat. I also recently made a live chat in Google Sheets using the Google Apps Script API! Definitely my coolest project.
- ✍🏽 &nbsp; Writing. I published two poetry books in 2024! You can read them on my website. They're a little flawed, but overall pretty cool. I'm working on a highly experimental third one that puts a narrative lens to my life and is presented in the style of a choose-your-own-adventure game. I think the idea's pretty cool. I've also been working on a novel and some other projects, but details will be secret for now...
- 😶 &nbsp; Starting ninety thousand projects and never finishing them. NEURODIVERGENCE WOOOO

<h3> Stalk Me </h3>
