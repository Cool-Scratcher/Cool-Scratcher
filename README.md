<h2> Hey! I'm Mohit Gore.</h2>

<h3> About Me </h3>
<p>An overly ambitious 17-year-old lover of words, film, logic, poetry, and prose.</p>

<h3> What I've Been Doing Lately </h3>

- 💾 &nbsp; (Slowly) getting back into coding. I've been adding the most insane things to my website, like easter eggs, a progression system for hidden content, etc. I also once made a live chat in Google Sheets using the Google Apps Script API!
- ✍🏽 &nbsp; Writing. I published two poetry books in 2024! You can read them on my website. They're a little flawed, but overall pretty cool. I began work on a third, but I don't know if I'll continue with it.
- 😶 &nbsp; Starting ninety thousand projects and never finishing them

<h3> Stalk Me </h3>
<p>Ya weirdo. But sure. Here's <a href="https://mohitgore.com/">my haphazard website</a>, and here's <a href="https://linktr.ee/mohitgore">my Linktree</a>.</p>
