<h2> Hey! I'm Mohit Gore.</h2>

<h3> About Me </h3>
<p>An overly ambitious 16-year-old lover of words, film, logic, poetry, and prose.</p>

<h3> What I've Been Doing Lately </h3>

- 🎨 &nbsp; (Slowly) getting back into coding. I recently updated my website and I think it's pretty neat. I also recently made a live chat in Google Sheets using the Google Apps Script API! Definitely my coolest project.
- ✍🏽 &nbsp; Writing. I published two poetry books in 2024! You can read them on my website. They're a little flawed, but overall pretty cool. I've also been working on a novel and webcomic, but no information can be revealed about those yet...
- 😵 &nbsp; School, sadly
- 😶 &nbsp; Starting ninety thousand projects and never finishing them. NEURODIVERGENCE WOOOO

<h3> Stalk Me </h3>
